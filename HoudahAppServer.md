# HoudahAppServer #

The HoudahAppServer framework acts as an extension to Appleâ€™s WebObjects/AppServer framework. As such it depends on the HoudahFoundation framework.

HoudahAppServer provides means for handling [client-side backtracking](ClientSideBacktracking.md) and implementing [server-side backtracking](ServerSideBacktracking.md).

HoudahAppServer has facilities for loading JavaScript and CSS into WebObjects pages in both development and deployment environments.
